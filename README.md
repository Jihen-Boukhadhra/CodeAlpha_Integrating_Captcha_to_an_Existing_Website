# CodeAlpha_Integrating_Captcha_to_an_Existing_Website
This project is my task2 as a web development intern at CodeAlpha. It's an intro to using third-party scripts on an existing website. This is also great practice in diving into documentation and taking a look at different types of CAPTCHA services. I used my recent repository (BMI Calculator) to integrate captcha!
